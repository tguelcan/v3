# Cookie Policy for Sobmit
Last updated: 20 June 2025

This Cookie Policy explains how Sobmit ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our web application Sobmit (the "App") and your choices regarding them. This policy should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy.

#### What are Cookies, Pixels, and Local Storage?
   Cookies: Small text files placed on your device by websites you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. 

Pixel Tags (Web Beacons or Pixels): Small blocks of code on a web page or in an email notification. They allow companies to collect information such as an individual's IP address, when the individual viewed the pixel, and the type of browser used. 

Local Storage: Allows a website to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. It is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain. 

It is important to understand that these technologies can collect both personal and non-identifiable information. Cookies can be first-party (set by the website you are visiting) or third-party (set by a domain other than the one you are visiting). 

#### How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

Strictly Necessary/Essential Cookies: These cookies are essential for the App to function correctly. They enable core functionalities like user authentication (e.g., keeping you logged in during a session) and cannot be switched off in our systems. Without these cookies, the App would not work properly. We are permitted to load these essential cookies based on our legitimate interests in delivering the App's essential functionality to you. 

Functionality Cookies: These cookies enable certain additional functionalities on our App, such as remembering your preferences (e.g., username) or assisting us in providing support services. This functionality improves user experience. 

Performance and Analytics Technologies: These technologies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our App. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors navigate the site. 

Vercel Analytics: Our App uses Vercel Web Analytics. It is designed to be privacy-focused and does not collect personal identifiers that track and cross-check end users' data across different applications or websites. Instead, end users are identified by a hash created from the incoming request. The lifespan of a visitor session is not stored permanently; it is automatically discarded after 24 hours. While Vercel Analytics itself is cookieless for end-user tracking, the Vercel platform may use its own performance-related cookies, such as  

__vercel_analytics, which can persist for up to 30 days for performance monitoring and site optimization.

#### Your Choices and Managing Cookies
   Under data protection laws like the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, we are generally required to obtain your explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies on your device.

Cookie Consent Banner: We will implement a cookie consent banner that provides clear information about the cookies we use and their purposes. This banner will allow you to accept all cookies, reject non-essential cookies, or customize your preferences. 

Withdrawal of Consent: You will have the option to easily withdraw your consent at any time, typically through a link in the footer of our website or within your account settings. 

Browser Settings: Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can usually configure your browser to block or delete cookies. However, disabling certain cookies may impact the functionality and user experience of our App. 

We recommend that you review your cookie preferences regularly. A link to this Cookie Policy will be prominently displayed in the footer of our website and potentially within our cookie consent banner.

We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookie Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
